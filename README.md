## About Computational Cosmology Group (CCG)
Shahid Beheshti University (SBU) hosts an active cosmology research group that has been working on various problems in this field for years. As cosmology has evolved into an exact science, it now employs sophisticated tools and methods to study the universe.​

**Our group** focuses on three main objectives: parameter estimation, model discrimination, and searching for new physics. To achieve these goals, we utilize a variety of statistical, geometrical, and topological tools, each playing a specific role in data analysis and extracting meaningful results.​​

## Purpose of This Repository
I created this repository to collect and organize documentation that would be useful for students and group members. Research work often requires access to scattered resources - statistical codes, reference papers, practical notes about using various tools.​

This is meant to be a shared reference that everyone can use and contribute to simultaneously. Hopefully, this will make the learning process easier for newcomers joining the group and facilitate knowledge sharing among current members.​

**In this repo, you'll find resources such as explanations of computational methods, sample codes, documentation for commonly used tools, and anything else we think might be helpful for the group.​**
